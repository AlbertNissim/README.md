# Information Architecture 

Ontology - The important features of my website are mainly the aestheitcs. In terms of content, I kept it pretty breif. The webpage linked to the home page has three paragraphs which discuss the early years, 1990's and post 2000 years' of the New York Knicks. Historically they are a very famous franchise for playing in Madison Square Garden which is located in the center of New York City. The image I chose for the background of the homepage is one that I really thought looked nice and one that many people may not have seen before. I also included their classic NBA logo as well as pictures from the 1970's, 1990's, and 2000's on the second page.  

Choreography - The choreography of this website is pretty self-explanitory. The home page has content in 5 sections, each corner and the center. Everything except the words ont the bottom-left are able to be clicked-on. Clicking the Knicks logo in the top-right brings you back to the homepage. The top-right sends you to the wikipedia page for the Knicks. Finally, the bottom-left brings you to a second HTML page that has some additional information about Knicks. On top there is a paragraph talking about their foundation, ownership, and championships. I then added three addtional paragraphs - one that talks about their early years, one that talks about their teams in the 1990's, and one about their struggles in the post-2000's years. 

# Design

Z-Pattern - Z-pattern is present on the first page of the website. I took it right from the examples posted online but made it my own by changing the fonts, sizs, images, and theme. 

F-Pattern - The second page contains three F-patterns within each of the three sections on the lower half of the page. 

C.R.A.P. - contrast, repetition, and allignment are all present on my webpage. The Knicks colors (blue, orange, white) naturally work well together so I stuck with those colors as a theme, using some black and grey when necessary. I have multiple F-patterns on my secondary page, and all my images allign throughout the website. 

Fonts - Gugi (font family: 'Gugi', cursive;)
        Gaegu (font family: 'Gaegu', cursive;)
        I think the fonts pair nicely together, there was no specific method to choosing them, I just tried a few combinations out and ended up liking this pairing the best. 

CSS Architecture - For the most part I followed the Z-pattern.
